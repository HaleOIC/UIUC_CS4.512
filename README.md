# UIUC_CS4.512

Elective supplementary courses in big data processing direction in HUST ECE, I select UIUC CS412 & CS512 for learning more about data mining, which may let me have a deeper understanding of data mining.

It sounds really cool, and helps me a lot in data analysis direction.

I will take CS412 fall2015 and CS512 fall2021, since there is no lectures videos to learn, all I can do is to read the lecture slides over and over again, and then do its corresponding assignments. Hope I can finish this course and truly have an understanding of DM.
